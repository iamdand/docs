## <Icon icon="exclamation-circle" size={32} className="inline-block mb-1" /> What you will build

In this tutorial, you'll build a **ReAct agent** (Reasoning + Acting) that intelligently manages a weekly event schedule. The agent will demonstrate:

- **Intelligent tool selection** - choosing the right tool based on context
- **Natural language understanding** - parsing user queries about dates and events

## Step 1: Create Your Project

<Tip>
<h3 className="mint-font-semibold mint-text-2xl dark:text-white">Prerequisites</h3>
- **Node.js v18+** installed
- An **OpenAI API key** ([Get one
  here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript/TypeScript

</Tip>

First, let's create a new directory for your agent:

```bash
mkdir langgraph-agent-tutorial && cd langgraph-agent-tutorial
```

Initialize a new Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y && npm pkg set type=module
```

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the required LangChain and LangGraph v1 packages:

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/openai @langchain/core zod
```

<Info>
  Starting with **LangChain** v1, **LangGraph** is the direct dependency for the
  langchain library, therefore we don't have to install it explicitely and it
  will be used under the hood. We are using `createAgent` API for building
  agents with minimal code, formerly the prebuilt agent implementation from
  langgraph library.
</Info>

---

## Step 3: Copy the Script

<Tip>
  Don't forget to replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key
  in the code below.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```javascript agent.js
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { createAgent } from "langchain";
import { z } from "zod";

// Sample weekly events data
const weekEvents = {
  monday: "Team standup meeting at 10 AM",
  tuesday: "Gym session at 6 PM",
  wednesday: "Office party at 7 PM",
  thursday: "Client presentation at 2 PM",
  friday: "Happy hour party at 5 PM",
  saturday: "Hiking trip with friends",
  sunday: "Relaxing day at home",
};

// Tool 1: Get All Events
const getAllEvents = tool(
  async () => {
    console.log("get_all_events called");
    return JSON.stringify(weekEvents, null, 2);
  },
  {
    name: "get_all_events",
    description:
      "Get the complete schedule for the entire week with all events. Use this when you need to see multiple days or filter events by type.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);

// Tool 2: Get Single Day Event
const getSingleDayEvent = tool(
  async ({ day }) => {
    console.log("get_single_day_event called");
    const normalizedDay = day.toLowerCase();
    const event = weekEvents[normalizedDay];
    return event ? `${day}: ${event}` : `No event found for ${day}`;
  },
  {
    name: "get_single_day_event",
    description:
      "Get the event for a specific day of the week. Accepts a day name (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday).",
    schema: z.object({
      day: z.string().describe("The day of the week to get the event for"),
    }),
  }
);

// Initialize the OpenAI model
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0,
  apiKey: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY", // Replace with your actual key
});

// Create the Agent
const agent = createAgent({
  model,
  tools: [getAllEvents, getSingleDayEvent],
  systemPrompt:
    "You are a helpful assistant that manages weekly event schedules. If the user doesn't specify what day it is today, assume today is Monday. Use get_all_events when you need to filter events or see multiple days. Use get_single_day_event when you need information about a specific day.",
});

// Run the Agent
const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: process.argv[2] || "Show all events" }],
});

// Output the final response
console.log(result.messages[result.messages.length - 1].content);
```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Step 4: You are done! Test Your Agent

We have declared a list of days and events that happen on those days (see below).

```javascript
const weekEvents = {
  monday: "Team standup meeting at 10 AM",
  tuesday: "Gym session at 6 PM",
  wednesday: "Office party at 7 PM",
  thursday: "Client presentation at 2 PM",
  friday: "Happy hour party at 5 PM",
  saturday: "Hiking trip with friends",
  sunday: "Relaxing day at home",
};
```

Now, you can ask your agent to answer questions about the events using the tools you created. Test how smart your agent is by asking it to find events based on different criteria. Don't make it too easy for it!

Run your agent with different queries to see intelligent tool selection in action:

### Test 1: Specific Day Query

```bash
node agent.js "What's happening on Friday?"
```

<Accordion title="What to expect from test 1">
  Now, that was easy! The agent should recognize that this is a direct query for
  a specific day and use the `get_single_day_event` tool to fetch Friday's
  event.
</Accordion>

### Test 2: Relative Day Calculation

```bash
node agent.js "Today is Tuesday, what event is tomorrow?"
```

<Accordion title="What to expect from test 2">
  This one takes a bit of reasoning. The agent figures out that tomorrow is
  Wednesday and uses `get_single_day_event("wednesday")`
</Accordion>

### Test 3: Filtering Query

```bash
node agent.js "Show me all the party events"
```

<Accordion title="What to expect from test 3">
  The agent should use the `get_all_events` tool to retrieve the full schedule
  and then filter for events containing "party".
</Accordion>

### Test 4: Default Day Behavior

```bash
node agent.js "What event is in 2 days?"
```

<Accordion title="What to expect from test 4">
  Since the agent assumes today is Monday (as per the system prompt), it should
  calculate Wednesday and use `get_single_day_event("wednesday")`.
</Accordion>

{/* <ColorHeader title="How It Works: The ReAct Pattern" /> */}

## How It Works: The ReAct Pattern

Your agent follows the **ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)** pattern:

![alt](/./images/langgraph-react-pattern-white.png "Agent Overview")

<Steps>
  <Step title="Input">The user provides a natural language query(\__start\__)</Step>
  <Step title="Reason">
    The agent receives a user query and analyzes what information it needs (model_request)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Act">
    The agent decides which tool(s) to call and executes them (tool_call)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Observe">The agent receives the tool results (model_request)</Step>
  <Step title="Respond">
    The agent formulates a natural language response based on the results (\__end\__)
  </Step>
</Steps>


<ColorBlock titl="Tool Selection Logic">

__Here's how the agent chooses between tools:__

| Query                               | Tool Selected          | Why?                                 |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| "What's on Friday?"                 | `get_single_day_event` | Direct day lookup                    |
| "Show me all parties"               | `get_all_events`       | Needs to filter across multiple days |
| "Today is Monday, event in 2 days?" | `get_single_day_event` | Calculates specific day (Wednesday)  |

</ColorBlock>

## Step by Step Explanation

### Create the Agent Script

Create a file called `agent.js`. Start by importing dependecies and defining the weekly events data:

```javascript agent.js
import { tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { createAgent } from "langchain";
import { z } from "zod";

// Sample weekly events data
const weekEvents = {
  monday: "Team standup meeting at 10 AM",
  tuesday: "Gym session at 6 PM",
  wednesday: "Office party at 7 PM",
  thursday: "Client presentation at 2 PM",
  friday: "Happy hour party at 5 PM",
  saturday: "Hiking trip with friends",
  sunday: "Relaxing day at home",
};

```

This simple object represents our weekly schedule that the agent will query.

### Define Your Tools

Tools are functions that your agent can call. We are creating 2 tools.

The first tool returns the entire week's schedule. The agent uses it when it needs to filter or compare multiple days.

```javascript agent.js
// Tool 1: Get All Events
const getAllEvents = tool(
  async () => {
    console.log("get_all_events called");
    return JSON.stringify(weekEvents, null, 2);
  },
  {
    name: "get_all_events",
    description:
      "Get the complete schedule for the entire week with all events. Use this when you need to see multiple days or filter events by type.",
    schema: z.object({}),
  }
);
```

The second tool returns a specific day's event. The agent uses it for direct day queries.

```javascript agent.js
// Tool 2: Get Single Day Event
const getSingleDayEvent = tool(
  async ({ day }) => {
    console.log("get_single_day_event called");
    const normalizedDay = day.toLowerCase();
    const event = weekEvents[normalizedDay];
    return event ? `${day}: ${event}` : `No event found for ${day}`;
  },
  {
    name: "get_single_day_event",
    description:
      "Get the event for a specific day of the week. Accepts a day name (monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, friday, saturday, sunday).",
    schema: z.object({
      day: z.string().describe("The day of the week to get the event for"),
    }),
  }
);
```

<Note>
  **Tool Design Tip:** The `description` field is crucial! It tells the LLM when
  and how to use each tool. Clear descriptions lead to better tool selection.
</Note>

### Initialize the Model

Configure the OpenAI model with your API key:

```javascript agent.js
const model = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
  temperature: 0,
  apiKey: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY", // Replace with your actual key
});
```

<Warning>
  **Security Note:** In production, never hardcode API keys. Use environment
  variables or a secrets manager instead.
</Warning>

### Create the Agent

Now for the magic! Use `createAgent` to build your ReAct agent:

```javascript agent.js
const agent = createAgent({
  model,
  tools: [getAllEvents, getSingleDayEvent],
  systemPrompt:
    "You are a helpful assistant that manages weekly event schedules. If the user doesn't specify what day it is today, assume today is Monday. Use get_all_events when you need to filter events or see multiple days. Use get_single_day_event when you need information about a specific day.",
});
```

<Info>
  **Under the Hood:** `createAgent` is built on top of LangGraph, giving you
  automatic support for persistence, streaming, and human-in-the-loop features.
</Info>

### Run the Agent

Add code to invoke the agent with a user query:

```javascript agent.js
// Run the Agent
const result = await agent.invoke({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: process.argv[2] || "Show all events" }],
});

// Output the final response
console.log(result.messages[result.messages.length - 1].content);
```
